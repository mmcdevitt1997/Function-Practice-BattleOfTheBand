<!-- A local nightclub is having a Battle of the Bands night in a few months. 
    They expect many bands to sign up because the grand prize is $20,000. 
    To make things easier on the nightclub management, they want each band to be
    assigned a number so that they can easily keep track of the order in which the bands will perform.

Your job is to write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. 
The function will increment a global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number,
 and the band name concatenated together.
